# Customer Segmentation

## Overview

The Customer Segmentation project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and segment customers based on their behavior, preferences, and interactions with a business. The primary goal is to gain insights into distinct customer groups, enabling personalized marketing strategies and tailored business approaches.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Dive into the customer dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relevant features that contribute to effective segmentation.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract and engineer features that capture the essence of customer behavior, demographics, and interactions with the business.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to segment customers into distinct groups.

- **Visualization:** Create visualizations to represent customer segments, making it easier to interpret and communicate insights to stakeholders.

- **Customer Profiling:** Develop detailed customer profiles for each segment, highlighting key characteristics and behaviors.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure the customer dataset is properly formatted and includes relevant features for segmentation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of key variables and identify potential patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Engineer features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture meaningful distinctions between customer segments.

4. **Model Training:** Implement clustering algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbor) and train the model on the prepared dataset.

5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to represent the identified customer segments and their characteristics.
